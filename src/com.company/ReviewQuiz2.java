    /*
    12- Inheritance- showing a relationship.
    Specifically the IS A- relationship.
    13 - Polymorphism - poly = many, Morphs = forms.
         Allow us to perform a single action in different ways
    14 - Static keyword - Used for memory management.
         Either a static variable or block.
    15 - Abstract classes Basically the Super Class. The blueprint
         Blueprint class can only be extended by subclass
    16 - Interfaces - Has the same capabilities of a Abstract
         class, but has no method bodies.
    17 - Constructors - Two types. Default and parameterized.
         Have the same name as the class its Constructing.
         Ends with : "()". ex. className();.
         If parameterized the () will have parameters.
         ex. className(int a, string b);
    18 - Collections framework is a group of classes provided by java for organizing and storing
         data. Collections are containers, an object that groups multiple elements into a single unit.
         Collections are used to store, retrieve, manipulate, and communicate data. Typically, they
         represent data items that form a natural group, such as a poker hand (a
         collection of cards), a mail folder (a collection of letters), or a telephone directory
         (a mapping of names to phone numbers).
         Benefit 1. Reduces programming effort
                 2. Reduces effort to design new APIs
                 3. Fosters software reuse

    18.1 - They represent a group of constants in a programming language. Think of the days of the
           week as an enumerated type. Also referred to as Enums, when constructed they know all the
           values at compile time. It is not required that these set of constants in a enum type stay
           fixed.

    19 - Exceptions in a nutshell is an abnormal condition that halts the completion of a process.
           Exceptions in computer science are an abnormal condition that halts the normal flow of an
          application.
          What is Exception Handling? The exception handling in java is one of the powerful mechanism
          to handle the runtime errors so that normal flow of the application can be maintained.
          Types of Exceptions
           1. Checked exceptions
           2. Unchecked Exceptions

    SDLC- “A process that produces software with the highest quality and lowest cost in the
           shortest time. SDLC includes a detailed plan for how to develop, alter, maintain,
           and replace a software system.” ~ Stackify
           Stages of SDLC:
           1. Required Analysis
           2. Design
           3. Implementation
           4. Testing
           5. Evolution

    Design Patterns

    1 - What is Object Oriented Programming? Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based
        on the concept of Objects, there Attributes and the Functions those objects can do.
        What are Version Control Systems? Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of
        files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. For the examples in this course you will use
        software source code as the files being version controlled, though in reality you can do this with nearly any
        type of file on a computer.

    2 - What is Java?  Java is a high level programming language developed by Sun Microsystems which
         was initiated by James Gosling and released in 1995. Java lured the marked with write once, run everywhere
         concept. Java has been evolving since its first version. The latest version released is java 8.0.
          Simple, Platform Independent, Object Oriented, Distributed, Multi-Threaded, Dynamic

    3 - Create a Java Project

    4 - Code Comments  Code comments are used to explain what your trying to do, or can also serve as a
        reminder to do something.
        There are two types of Code Comments: Single and Multi-line comments.

    5 - Strings in Java  Strings, which are widely used in Java programming, are a sequence of characters.
                         In the Java programming language, strings are objects.
        1. String Literal
        2. The New keyword

    6 - Primitive types and variables   A primitive variable is just a cup, it holds something like a container.
                                        Based on the type of primitive variable the size of the cup varies.

    6.1 - 3 Types of Variables in Java:
          1. Local Variable- A Variable that is declared inside a method. This variable is only accessible within
                             the method that it was constructed.
          2. Instance Variables- Also called a member variable it is declared inside the class, but outside a method.
                     This variable can be accessed from any method of the class it was created in.
          3. Static Variable

    7 - Java Operator Categories  Arithmetic Operators, Relational Operators, Bitwise Operators, Logical Operators,
                                  Assignment Operators

    8 - Control Flow  Usually in java the code is executed from top to bottom as they appear.
                      Control flow statements help break up the flow of execution by employing decision
                      making, looping, and branching, enabling your program to conditionally execute
                      particular blocks of code.

    9. Class A    class is a blueprint for creating objects.
                  A class describes what an object knows and what an object does, which is called state.
                  Things an object knows are its instance variables (attributes). - Their state
                  Things an object does are methods (functions). - Their behavior
       Objects and methods
                  Objects are instances of a class. You can think of them as a copy of the blueprint.
                  Each instance of an object can define their own state.
                  The behavior (method) of an object is an action of what it can do.

    10 - Access Modifiers   The access modifiers in Java specifies accessibility (scope) of a data member, method,
                            constructor or class.
         There are 4 types of Java access modifiers:
           ● private- The methods or data members declared as private are accessible only within the class in which
                       they were created.
           ● default- When no access modifier is specified for a class, method or data member it is said to have a
                       default access modifier, by default.
                       Data members, classes or methods that are not declared using any access modifiers are
                       accessible only within the same package.
           ● protected- The methods or data members declared as protected are accessible within same package or sub
                        classes in different package. Classes can not use the protected modifier.
           ● public- The public modifier has the largest scope of all access modifiers.
                      Classes, methods or data members that are declared as public are accessible from everywhere in
                      the program. There is no restriction on the scope of public data members.

    11 - What is Encapsulation?
            Encapsulation is the process of wrapping data(variables) and the code into a single unit. For
            example: a capsule mixed with several medicines.
            We can create a fully encapsulated class in java by making all the data members of the class
            private. Now we can use setter and getter methods to set and get the data in it.
